In May 2013, we announced "New Strategic Direction―Charting a new path toward sustainable growth." Based on the issues that were brought into sharp focus during the course of the three-year Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 and changes in our operating environment in Japan and overseas, we revisited one fundamental question: "What is the value of a sogo shosha?" This prompted us to reassess how we set growth targets, profit plans, as well as management frameworks and other matters.

	<b><a name="T2">Our Business Environment and Pressing Issues </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Geopolitical risks have come to prominence in various regions around the world amid the drawn-out European crisis and slowing growth in emerging markets. Volatility in financial markets and resource prices will also require continued vigilance going forward, and uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook will continue. On a brighter note, the Asian economy is expected to see comparatively robust growth, raising hopes that it will drive the global economy.
<br><br>
The uncertain external business environment presents risks for MC. But it presents new business opportunities as well.
<br><br>
As the reshaping of MC has occurred faster than expected due to changes in our business model and business sites, we must concentrate more on maintaining balance sheet discipline, raising profitability and tackling other management themes. We are also being compelled to think again about how we manage the company and set performance targets. This is due to the special nature of our business as a sogo shosha, a unique business model that comprises both resource and non-resource businesses.
<br><br>
Facing these issues head on, we revisited the fundamental questions of "What value does a sogo shosha create?" and "What is the value of Mitsubishi Corporation?" We formulated New Strategic Direction after reviewing how we set growth targets, management frameworks and other matters.<br><br>

New Strategic Direction redefines MC's value as a sogo shosha that is capable of "providing upside potential as well as stable earnings throughout business cycles by managing a portfolio diversified by business model, industry, market and geography." We also identified three themes: time horizon management, growth vision, and portfolio vision.<br><br>

In terms of the time horizon, with our business models and external business environment changing dynamically, we believed we had to shift from a conventional midterm management plan approach, one that centered on a three-year financial target, to formulating strategy with a longer-term perspective. Therefore, we adopted a "future pull" approach that looks ahead to circa 2020.<br><br>

Our growth vision sets the goal of doubling the size of our business by around 2020.<br><br>

By that time, we aim to have more than 10 business sub-segments in our portfolio that generate net income of at least YEN20.0 billion, and another 10 to 15 that can generate between YEN10.0 billion and YEN20.0 billion. To do this we will narrow down our business sub-segments, being mindful of strengthening multiple "winning businesses" in an appropriately diversified business portfolio.<br><br>

Let me explain our management policies for realizing our "future pull" growth scenario for the MC Group around 2020.<br><br>

Principles: New Strategic Direction continues our drive under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012 to create sustainable corporate value. We aim to further increase societal value and environmental value by redoubling efforts on a consolidated and global basis. Furthermore, we plan to strengthen "winning businesses" through the proactive reshaping of our portfolio in order to win against competition on a global scale.<br><br>

Investment Policy: We will accelerate divestments selectively and free up capital for new investments, while continuing to invest at a rate in line with the average of the last three years under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, in order to improve our earnings base.<br><br>

Financial Discipline: We will increase our focus on financial discipline, including funding our investments within our own cash flow. And we plan to deliver a return on equity of 12-15% over the medium to long term.<br><br>

Dividend Policy: We will introduce a two-staged dividend policy with a base and a variable portion in order to provide a stable dividend to shareholders regardless of changes in the business environment.<br><br>

In our resource businesses, we will focus on the profitability of projects which will primarily entail expanding our existing asset base (coking coal, copper, LNG, and other core assets) and projects in the pipeline. At the same time, we will refocus on capital and operational costs to improve our competitiveness.<br><br>
Coking Coal Business:
We are expanding our coking coal business centered on BMA in which we own a 50% stake through our wholly owned resource subsidiary Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd (MDP). BMA owns seven coal mines in Queensland, Australia, and MC's equity share of production is approximately 20 million tons of coking coal per year. Plans call for production to be increased by approximately 5 million tons in terms of MC's equity share through expansion by the year ending March 31, 2015.<br><br>

LNG and Shale Gas Businesses:<br><br>
At present, we are working to provide a stable supply of LNG through nine projects. In 2012, we decided to invest in new projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and by the end of March 2015, the first shipments should be emerging from the Donggi-Senoro LNG Project in Indonesia. In tandem, we are developing shale gas business in Canada.<br><br>

Copper Business:<br><br>
We are operating four projects in Chile and Peru, with the copper supplied mainly to Asia.<br><br>

Our attributable copper production from these projects is approximately 250,000 tons. We plan to expand business going forward, including at Chile's Escondida, one of the world's largest copper mines, in which we have been participating since 1988, and Anglo American Sur S.A., a Chilean company in which we acquired an approximate 20% interest in 2011.<br><br>

In non-resource businesses, we will proactively reshape the portfolio in line with our long-term vision of creating multiple sizable "winning businesses," while deploying management resources to the most promising opportunities.<br><br>

We will implement this shift of management resources based on three criteria―level of earnings, ROE and growth potential―in accordance with the Business Sub-Segments Evaluation Matrix (diagram). This will allow us to narrow down the number of business sub-segments and focus resources on “winning businesses.”<br><br>


Businesses Targeted for Further Expansion<br><br>
Automotive, foods, foods retail, power generation, life science, etc.<br><br>

Business Model Innovation<br><br>
North American shale gas downstream, asset management in the finance business, etc.<br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">Market Strategy </a><br><br>

Our market strategy calls for us to accelerate our global business development by leveraging our shift towards Asian markets, which are gaining greater international presence not only as resource rich and industrial nations, but as consumer markets as well. Our objective is to ensure sustainable growth by capturing growth in Asia. This will entail securing global supply sources to meet increasing demand for raw materials and other commodities in Asia, where relatively strong growth is expected, and establishing a local presence within the region, through M&As, strategic alliances, and other proactive initiatives.<br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">Market Strategy </a><br><br>

Markets From a Hub for Human Resources and Information<br><br>
Transferring headquarters coordination responsibilities for the mineral resources trading business overseas is a new paradigm and this has kept us on edge in a good way. Singapore is a hub for human resources and information, so we think we can raise our competitiveness in the global market by strengthening our mineral resources procurement and sales functions there. This move also aims to enhance our existing services in the Japanese market as well.<br><br>

Through close collaboration with Mineral Resources Investment Division A, Mineral Resources Investment Division B and the MC Group, RtM International will develop people highly sensitive to market and customer needs, so that we can provide even more value to customers. We hope to earn wide recognition in the industry as a global resources trader.<br><br>


Business Development Stratregy<br><br>

As we drive forward with our business portfolio strategy, we will actively develop new business domains that will form part of MC's future portfolio.<br><br>

Each business group is pursuing business development in existing business domains and peripheral areas. In addition to these ongoing efforts, I myself will take the lead in targeting new growth fields―fields that cannot be sufficiently covered by existing business groups. In this way, I am determined to optimize our portfolio to drive our growth as a sogo shosha.<br><br>

Under New Strategic Direction, we have stepped up initiatives in environment-related fields, which we have designated as a new target domain for business development. And our Business Service Group plans to actively utilize IT and develop IT services that will power the expansion of all our business groups.<br><br>

In terms of our market strategy, we plan to develop business in countries and regions that are expected to grow dramatically going forward. With a medium- to long-term perspective, we believe that we will benefit from growth in these countries and regions.<br><br>

In the process of contributing to the development of these countries and regions, we will forge long-lasting relationships of trust with local partners and customers. Our goal is to increase our presence by developing multifarious businesses that draw on collective strengths unique to MC.<br><br>

New Strategic Direction earmarks YEN100.0 billion for strategic investments over 3 years for this growth push.

	<b><a name="T6">A Message From the CFO </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
In delivering our annual report for the year ended March 2013, it is my pleasure to review our performance for this past fiscal year and discuss our capital structure policy under New Strategic Direction.<br><br>

In the year ended March 2013, net income was YEN360.0 billion, YEN30.0 billion more than the YEN330.0 billion downwardly revised forecast we issued in October 2012. This was achieved despite the negative impact on our earnings of lower sales prices at our Australian coking coal business and other factors. The better-than-forecast outcome was attributable to higher earnings in the Energy Business Group, as well as non-resource fields, namely the Industrial Finance, Logistics & Development, Machinery and Living Essentials groups. Based on the YEN360.0 billion bottom-line result, we paid an annual dividend per share applicable to the year ended March 2013 of YEN55, which at 25% was the upper limit of the consolidated dividend payout ratio target range set in Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, our previous medium-term management plan.<br><br>

Total shareholders' equity was YEN4,179.7 billion as of March 31, 2013, up YEN671.9 billion from March 31, 2012. During the year ended March 2013, we made investments of approximately YEN930.0 billion, balanced between resource and non-resource fields.<br><br>

To make these investments, we procured additional funds through bank loans and bond issuances. Even so, we maintained a net debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0, about the same financially sound level as March 31, 2012. While operating activities provided net cash of approximately YEN400.0 billion, free cash flow was negative, as we continued to make substantial investments.<br><br>

In order to maximize our corporate value, we plan to continue investing under our New Strategic Direction vision at a rate in line with the past three years. We will fund these investments by reshaping our asset portfolio through divestments and generating profits from operations. In addition, by actively reaping the benefits of past investments, we aim to increase earnings and generate positive free cash flow again.<br><br>

While the external business environment is expected to remain opaque going forward, as CFO of Mitsubishi Corporation, my aim is to build a strong earnings structure while maintaining financial discipline, and in this way support the implementation of New Strategic Direction.<br><br>

The Global Environmental & Infrastructure Business Group mainly handles trade and related business operations in the power generation, water, transportation, and backbone infrastructure sectors, all of which have a direct impact on our quality of life. We are active in a number of areas that help to combat global warming and secure sustainable supplies of energy, such as our renewable energy and emissions reduction businesses. We are also involved in smart community projects and lithium-ion batteries that are so essential to today's environmentally friendly vehicles and electricity storage.
<br><br>
Our aims are to foster the growth of stable, long-term earnings drivers and raise our corporate value, all the while working towards the realization of a sustainable society. Ours is a long-term approach, and we remain committed to developing the mechanisms, technologies, and systems that will enable more people to live on fewer resources.
<br><br>
The Global Environment & Infrastructure Business Development Group, which was established as a group directly under the president, was reorganized into a business group on July 1, 2013, when it became the Global Environmental & Infrastructure Business Group.<br><br>


The Global Environment & Infrastructure Business Development Group aimed to promote new energy and environmental and water businesses, and establish earnings models, and at the same time worked to strengthen and integrate infrastructure businesses. In July 2013, it took its first steps as a business group with a three-division structure: Environmental Business Division, New Energy & Power Generation Division, and Infrastructure Business Division.
<br><br>
The Global Environmental & Infrastructure Business Group engages in power generation, water, and transportation projects, plus industrial infrastructure businesses in each of these key sectors. Our group also handles lithium-ion batteries for use in electric vehicles and industry, magnets, ESCO operations, and other environmental businesses.

We were hit hard by 2008's global financial crisis. In the year ended March 2011, however, the group embarked on a three-year rebuilding program. During that time, we worked at rebuilding our business framework, and putting growth strategies into action. In the year ended March 2013, net income surpassed our initial target, reaching YEN25.0 billion. At the same time, we laid the foundations for further growth by taking some of the steps we deemed necessary for pursuing future strategies. These included the establishment of an asset management company in the U.S., and expansion of our real estate development business in China.<br><br>

Among domestic institutional investors in particular, there has been a shift of sorts out of traditional asset classes such as bonds and equities, and into real estate, aircraft, ships and other real assets. We believe these changes will provide increasing opportunities for us to leverage our knowledge of industry and asset management functions, to provide financing and solutions in a manner unique to a sogo shosha.<br><br>
By 2020, our aim is to grow the group's business model into a single "brand" recognized and esteemed by the customers and industries with which we are involved. To that end, we will expand our offerings to customers in both qualitative and quantitative terms, by establishing a business model and value chain marrying the Group's knowledge and capabilities across the fields of real estate, infrastructure, logistics, private equity, ships, and aircraft; and also venturing into arenas with which we are not so familiar.<br><br>

On the subject of real assets, institutional investors overseas have expanded their horizons beyond real estate and movables (such as aircraft and ships), and are also actively investing in infrastructure, including airports, harbors, and roads. In response to this phenomenon among investors worldwide, we are stepping up efforts at home and abroad, to structure, manage, and sell financial products encompassing a variety of asset classes, including infrastructure.<br><br>

Japan's energy industry has had to contend with dizzying changes in the business climate; among them global warming, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the nuclear shutdown it precipitated, the shale gas revolution, and oil refinery closure and integration. Against this backdrop, and in line with our medium- to long-term goal of becoming a unique and sustainable energy business group, we commenced domestic gas production at the Kangean block offshore Indonesia, embarked on LNG operations in Australia and developed our shale gas businesses. In the wake of the 2011 earthquake, we mobilized all available resources to aid electric power companies in emergency procurement of LNG as well as oil and LPG. We did our utmost to ensure stable supplies of energy. In addition, with added support from high crude oil prices, we performed solidly in the year ended March 2013.<br><br>

The projected increase in global energy demand should greatly expand business opportunities for us. At the same time, the U.S. shale gas revolution has the potential to hugely alter the business climate in the energy sector, on a scale greater than changes already witnessed. Under these circumstances, we believe it will become all the more important to accelerate cooperation with existing partners under the relationships of mutual trust we have developed, as well as to cooperate with other business groups within MC, fully utilizing our collective strength as a sogo shosha.<br><br>

In resource businesses (natural gas and E&P), we have sown the seeds for new projects that should be able to withstand changes in the business climate through 2020. In the coming three years, our first priority is to see those seeds sprout. In non-resource businesses (petroleum, carbon, and LPG), we aim to build robust business models that are appropriate for the times, amid expectations for increasing energy demand in emerging countries spurred by economic growth.<br><br>

We are developing the Donggi-Senoro LNG Project in Indonesia, a shale gas business in western Canada, and upstream and liquefaction businesses in Australia. We are also engaged in the importation, offshore trading and domestic trading of crude oil, petroleum products, carbon products, and LPG. We are aiming to enhance our overall ability, by maintaining and expanding the energy value chain from upstream to downstream.<br><br>

In our resource investments, we have been building a balanced portfolio of interests including coking coal, thermal coal, iron ore, copper, raw materials for stainless steel and PGM* under Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012. In our trading operations, in April 2013 we established subsidiaries Mitsubishi Corporation RtM International Pte. Ltd., which is based in Singapore and will serve as a global headquarters, and Mitsubishi Corporation RtM Japan Ltd., to upgrade our mineral resources trading functions. In the steel products sector, we have taken steps to strengthen our earnings drivers in overseas growth markets while also rebuilding domestic operations.<br><br>

*PGM: Platinum Group Metals (platinum, palladium, and other platinum group metals)<br><br>


Although prices for main resources have fallen significantly due to the European debt crisis and the slowing of the Chinese economy, we see the twin forces of urbanization and industrialization in the developing world, led by China, continuing to drive growth in global demand over the medium and long term. We expect a gradual recovery in demand and prices for mineral resources and products. We continue to target higher corporate value and sustained growth by creating synergies from the integration of our resource investment and trading operations.<br><br>

We are assessing investments in new resource projects using strict criteria so that we can achieve disciplined growth aligned with demand expansion. With existing projects, we are working to reduce costs continuously to reinforce competitiveness, while also improving investment returns and replacing assets. Keeping a strong sense of ownership and honing our market instincts will be vital in achieving the goals of New Strategic Direction. This means accelerating HR development programs to build MC's global business skills base by sharing knowledge about resource supply regions and end-user markets. <br><br>

We believed it was necessary to recast our business in a more customer-centric mold. That is why we have established the RtM International headquarters in Singapore and Mitsubishi Corporation RtM Japan Ltd. By sharing the raw market intelligence that we gather through our mineral resources trading operations and analyzing this information from various angles, we aim to make better resource investment decisions and improve management of our project assets to enhance value across the mineral resources value chain.<br><br>

We exceeded our net income target each year despite having faced varied challenges such as the strong yen, a slump in the shipping market, Sino-Japanese tensions, and floods in Thailand. This reflects the tenacity and skill of all our employees working in MC and Group affiliates around the world amid harsh conditions. I would like to thank everybody for these achievements.<br><br>

Conditions in automobile-related sectors remain tough in China, where tensions still persist, and in Europe due to the sovereign debt crisis. ASEAN nations and other developing countries continue to drive vehicle demand, which we will try to capture. The weaker yen will help us pursue gains in these markets. We expect the ship market and vehicle and construction machinery sales in China to recover gradually. In Japan, we see a new opportunity in construction machinery rentals as a custom service, which will help MC to make broader social and economic contributions in this area.<br><br>

To achieve the major target of doubling our earnings by 2020, we must select and strengthen the winning businesses in our existing portfolio. New income streams will also be needed. In April 2013, we completed a reorganization to focus primarily on transportation machinery and highvolume machinery and equipment. We plan to make the most of the Group's knowledge and human resources to reinforce our business strengths and to develop new businesses. Looking to the future, we will create frameworks for each of our businesses to enhance our ability to withstand the changing external conditions. 
<br><br>
In the automobile-related sector, our core businesses are in Indonesia and Thailand. However, we are also developing new earnings drivers in partnership with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation to sell vehicles in Russia and to manufacture and sell vehicles in China, and in partnership with Isuzu Motors Limited to manufacture and sell vehicles in India. In the ship business sector, we are planning to adjust our portfolio of company-owned vessels to reinforce competitiveness and expand operations generating stable income streams. We plan to promote and enhance our business for LNG shipping (owning & operation), and for related vessels to be used in offshore exploration. In addition, we plan to deepen our involvement in the elevator business as part of efforts to raise profitability.<br><br>

Over the plan period, we focused on strengthening our existing businesses and creating new income streams. We expanded and reinforced our business platform by doubling production capacity at petrochemical operations in Saudi Arabia and at our gas chemical business in Venezuela. Furthermore, Chuo Kagaku Co., Ltd., a leading plastic food packaging and containers manufacturer, became an MC consolidated subsidiary. In the life sciences field, we took on a new business challenge by starting custom manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals in the U.K. and the U.S. We also moved to acquire Kirin Kyowa Foods Company, Limited, a leading Japanese seasonings and food ingredients company. In the fertilizer sector, we are advancing a rock phosphate mining development project in Peru. These ventures will grow into core businesses for the Chemicals Group in the future.<br><br>

We expect continuing headwinds from the oversupply of petrochemicals in China and economic uncertainties in Europe, among other factors. On the other hand, the shale gas revolution in North America is creating new business opportunities as structural change sweeps the global chemicals industry. Other major trends also spell opportunity, such as the need to increase global food production, the expansion of consumer markets with the economic growth of emerging countries, and the growing interest in health, safety, comfort and the environment.
<br><br>
We plan to continue enhancing our existing core businesses in the fields of petrochemicals, fertilizers and plastics, while at the same time transforming in step with market changes. Our continuing challenge in the life sciences field is to expand contract manufacturing of pharmaceutical and agrochemical raw materials. In the food science field, we aim to develop the business globally based on Japanese technology and culture, in particular targeting the growing consumer markets of Asia.<br><br>

The shale gas revolution will have a major strategic impact on neighboring countries looking to produce natural gas for the North American market. We are developing a gas chemical business project in Trinidad and Tobago, which will help to address the issue of utilizing locally produced natural gas effectively. In Asia, where automobile production is growing rapidly, we are establishing manufacturing operations in Malaysia for synthetic rubber for use in tires. By leveraging MC's global network, the Chemicals Group aims to achieve sustainable growth by responding to evolving market needs and creating new business opportunities.<br><br>

Commodity Chemicals Division A<br><br>
 Olefins & Aromatics Dept.<br><br>
 Petrochemical Intermediates Dept.<br><br>
 Polyester Dept.<br><br>
 Chlor-Alkali Dept.<br><br>
We trade raw materials for plastics and synthetic fibers, salt and caustic soda, among other commodities, in the fields of petrochemicals and chlor-alkali. We also make investments in businesses in these fields.<br><br>

In the year ended March 2013, market conditions were sluggish, due to continuing softness in demand caused by the global economic malaise and excess capacity in China. However, we still expanded our trading base by making progress with our efforts to develop within China, with a focus on polyester raw materials.<br><br>

We expect to see ongoing major structural changes in the petrochemical industry and in distribution flows going forward. These changes are being catalyzed by a notable resurgence in the petrochemical industry in North America on the back of shale gas development. In response, we will leverage our expansive worldwide network to grasp changes in the business environment and customer needs, and by correcting imbalances between supply and demand in the market, we will strive to deliver value.<br><br>
Commodity Chemicals Division B<br><br>
 Methanol Dept.<br><br>
 Ammonia Dept.<br><br>
 Fertilizer Dept.<br><br>
 Inorganic Chemicals Dept.<br><br>
In the Commodity Chemicals Division B, we trade chemical commodities such as methanol, ethanol, ammonia, fertilizers, and sulfur and sulfuric acid. We also make investments in businesses.
<br><br>
Demand for products in the year ended March 2013 was generally solid for all products in this division. Furthermore, the division began looking at developing a business for manufacturing methanol, which uses natural gas as the main feedstock, in Trinidad and Tobago, with the aims of meeting growing demand particularly in emerging markets and securing supplies.
<br><br>
Going forward, this division will continue working to meet expanding demand in growth markets. For this, we will pursue opportunities to invest in businesses based on competitive natural gas and scarce raw materials used for making fertilizer. These investments will ensure the stable procurement of products and expand and enhance our value chains. And by strengthening our trading functions we aim to provide even more value to customers.<br><br>
Functional Chemicals Division<br><br>
 Plastics Dept.<br><br>
 PVC Dept.<br><br>
 Functional Materials Dept.<br><br>
 Specialty Chemicals Dept.<br><br>
This division conducts trading activities and makes investments to reinforce these activities in the midstream and downstream segments of the chemicals industry. Businesses extend from raw materials and other materials used in plastics and functional products to parts and finished products.<br><br>

The year ended March 2013 saw a tough business environment defined by lackluster demand because of the global economic sluggishness, and persistently high raw materials prices. Nevertheless, we expanded operations in emerging countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America.<br><br>

In the year ending March 2014, we intend to focus on expanding our food packaging materials business in China through Chuo Kagaku Co., Ltd. in which we acquired a controlling interest in 2012. This drive will see us try to capture even more synergies with this company in terms of procuring plastic raw materials and product sales.<br><br>

We will also work to develop our businesses within the functional products field, such as synthetic rubber and cosmetic raw materials, through investments, as we seek to sustain growth globally and meet customer needs.<br><br>

Life Sciences Division<br><br>
 Bio-Fine Chemicals Dept.<br><br>
 Life Science Products Dept.<br><br>

This division is chiefly engaged in the food science, pharmaceutical and agrochemical business domains where key themes are health, safety, comfort and good taste. Rising living standards and demand for food in emerging markets, and falling birthrates and aging populations as well as curbs on medical expenses in developed countries are some of the changes taking place in the structure of the global market today that are driving expansion in our business domains. In the year ended March 2013, we established Mitsubishi Corporation Life Sciences Limited, putting in place a framework for the unified management of existing subsidiaries in the food science field. In another move, we decided to acquire Kirin Kyowa Foods Company, Limited, one of Japan s leading food science companies.<br><br>

In the year ending March 2014, each food science company will steadily execute their growth strategies, with the aim of becoming a food science group that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the world s leading companies in this domain. We will also continue strengthening the pharmaceutical and agrochemical custom manufacturing business.<br><br>

We focused on three key themes: (1) expanding and improving our raw materials procurement network, (2) strengthening our Japan business base, and (3) targeting overseas growth markets.<br><br>

To expand and improve MC's raw materials procurement network, we invested in a grain procurement business in Brazil and in seafood farming ventures in Chile and Thailand. To strengthen our Japan business base, we merged four food distribution wholesale subsidiaries into Mitsubishi Shokuhin Co., Ltd. and made YONEKYU CORPORATION an MC subsidiary to help reinforce the structure of the Living Essentials Group. As part of targeting overseas growth markets, we made investments in manufacturing and retailing ventures to create new earnings drivers in developing countries.<br><br>


The lack of large demand growth prospects in Japan is forcing major changes in many industries. Leveraging MC's strengths in upstream to downstream operations across a wide range of consumer goods domains, we are steadily enhancing our market presence in Japan by reacting flexibly to structural changes within industries. With many firms seeking to expand offshore in earnest, we are also looking to create new growth opportunities in overseas markets based on technologies and business models honed in Japan.<br><br>


We are following two main policies. First, amid more intense competition in Japan, we are responding to structural change within domestic industries by seeking to raise efficiency and reinforce functions in the areas of retail, intermediary distribution, production and processing operations. Second, working in conjunction with strong local business partners, we are focusing on the overseas development of consumer goods business models already established in Japan, especially targeting developing countries in Asia with high rates of economic growth. We want to establish business platforms overseas that are the equal of those in Japan. <br><br>

They are improving the quality of group management on a consolidated basis and developing skilled people.<br><br>

Obviously it is critical to promote the growth of business investees that are consolidated in MC's accounts. In the management of the consolidated business, we are also seeking to ensure that the total value created is more than the sum of the parts. For this, we are making a concerted effort to develop people with the requisite cross-cultural business skills to strengthen the Group's ability to manage operations across domains.<br><br>
