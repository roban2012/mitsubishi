Japan Facility Solutions, Inc. ESCO事业 日本<br><br> 

Many companies and organizations have similar problems on their buildings and facilities which requires energy efficiency retrofit. But it is not easy to implement this. There are so many barriers including;<br><br>

 1. lack of experts, knowledge and know-how about energy efficiency<br><br>
 2. lack of money for energy efficiency retrofit<br><br>
 3. lack of confidence on the performance of energy efficiency measures<br><br>

 The business scheme of Energy Service Company (ESCO) has three (3) functions including engineering, financing, and management.<br><br>
 These functions of ESCO will overcome these barriers and to smoothly promote the energy efficiency of buildings and factories. ESCO can move forward the energy efficiency project which had stopped for a long time. <br><br>


In ESCO projects, all the necessary investments shall be carried out by energy service companies (ESCO), and our customers don’t have to be worried about the money to cover the investment＊. Customers shall just pay the monthly fee for ESCO service out of the savings of energy cost. This monthly fee covers maintenance of equipments, measurements and verifications, relevant taxes, insurances and so forth. So it is easy for our customers to identify the financial advantages of introducing ESCO services for their facilities. In addition, ESCO service fees can be recognized as annual payment, which does not affect the management index of ROA <br><br>
ESCO shall, in the beginning, make a simple audit on customers facilities by walk-through audit and by analyzing the energy consumption data. This enables us to roughly grasp the possible energy saving measures and potential energy cost reduction. After the customer confirms to step forward, ESCO will carry out the detailed audit with measuring devices and discuss the concrete ways to retrofit the facilities and will propose the guaranteed cost reduction and the ESCO service fee.<br><br>
 Then, the final step shall come where the details of the ESCO contract will be discussed with our customers, including finance plan and measurement and verification. <br><br>

 It is very important for energy efficiency retrofit to keep the performance for a long time. ESCO can provide this by measuring the energy efficiency performance for the contracted period and these data shall be reported to the customers.
 If the performance of energy efficiency were not enough to the contracted figures, ESCO would provide the additional energy efficiency measures of tunings and retrofits. And if these measures could not meet the criteria of guaranteed performance of energy efficiency, ESCO would be prepared to compensate the balance financially. <br><br>



Towards the low carbon society with our integrated solution in both energy and CO2<br><br>

Japan Facility Solutions, Incorporated was established in 2000, funded by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Mitsubishi Corporation, Kandenko Co.,Ltd, and Azbil Corporation. At that time, original concept of ESCO which is called Performance Contracting was not so well recognized by the business community. Since then, with precious support from our customers and stakeholders, JFS, as the leading company of Japanese ESCOs, is proud of its achievements of energy service contracts with many big buildings, factories, and other facilities.<br><br>

Nowadays, in addition to ESCO services, we are expanding our services to meet the potential requirements of customers. In 2008, we have developed new service which is called ”@ energy” which enables energy management of companies as a whole through ASP. This service is now serving as much as 37,000 sites.<br><br>

Environmental regulation shall be strengthened in many countries and it is necessary for companies around the world to meet the requirement of CSR including environmental issue. It is our pleasure to serve your business activities as your partner to reduce your energy consumption and CO2 emission.<br><br>

<a href= "link03.html">The Three Corporate Principles</a><br><br>


The Power & Electrical Systems Division contributes to the stable power supply all over the world through the supply of electric power systems. Our activity includes proactively identifying customer requirements, recommending suitable project plan, organizing necessary financing, EPC(*) contract execution and subsequent after-sales services. The types of equipment dealing in our division are extended to various types of power plants including thermal, hydro and geothermal, transmission lines and substation equipment. Our division is active throughout the world, particularly in Asia, Central and South America, Europe, and the Middle East by using the overseas network of Mitsubishi Corporation and our division staff posted to worldwide locations.<br><br>
 (*) EPC: Engineering, Procurement and Construction<br><br>

 Transportation Systems Division is actively being involved in transportation infrastructure business, a sector which impacts directly on people’s daily lives, having a potential growth and a high contribution to the society. The export of transportation systems having Japanese high-technology will not only help emerging nations establish their infrastructure, but it also alleviates the traffic congestion that threatens economic growth and plays a role in resolving a global-scale problem by creating a low-carbon society. In addition to exports from Japan, our work also boosts regional development such as employment creation and others, by assembling and manufacturing products locally. <br><br>

 Examples of projects, of which we have been undertaking contract execution and/or after-services in recent years includes:<br><br>
 [1] Cairo Metro in Egypt, a public work well valued and being so called “The fourth pyramid”.<br><br>
 [2] Delhi Metro in India, a world-first railway project being registered with CDM*, by its introduction of Japanese energy-saving technology.<br><br>
 [3] Dubai Metro, a turnkey contract for the world’s longest driverless railway service. The scope of the project is from design and construction to commencing operation.<br><br>
 [4] Electric towing locomotives used to assist vessels passing through the Panama Canal.<br><br>

 Wide range of functions such as targeting projects, conducting feasibility studies, arranging finance, and setting-up consortiums, are required as a trading company for transportation business. Furthermore, roles as a railway project developer with contractual responsibilities, such as track design/tracking works, supply of rolling stocks, signals and communication systems, traffic management, and serving maintenance are being required in nowadays. We, Transportation Systems Division, support these activities by striving to acquire diverse demands and provide best solutions to each customer.<br><br>
 * CDM: Clean Development Mechanism<br><br>



 The Plant Project Division consists of the First and Second Steel, Energy & Chemical Plant Departments and the Turbomachinery Department. The Steel, Energy & Chemical Plant Department 1&2 operate a plant business for the steel, cement, energy, and petrochemical sectors, working in collaboration with major equipment suppliers, engineering and construction companies in the world for twenty years. To continue responding to the customer’s requirement, we will provide them with support every step of the way of supplying the most suitable plant and equipment making use of the various experience and know how in the fields.<br><br>
 The Turbomachinery Department, meanwhile, handles the global sales of compressors manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Compressor Corporation for petrochemical plants such as ethylene and fertilizer including those utilizing Shale Gas as a feedstock, LNG liquefaction plants, FPSO (floating production, storage and offloading facilities) and oil refineries, etc. Its activities range from identifying leads through to sales, contract negotiation, execution, and after-sales service.<br><br>
 Through these activities, the Plant Project Division operates an extensive worldwide network involving the supply of large quantities of important equipment to key industrial sectors, including energy, petrochemicals, and steel, and providing reliable after-sales service. The division also constantly strives to utilize the information obtained through these activities to further improve service and take on new opportunities.<br><br>

 The Marine Machinery Division supplies various kinds of marine machinery such as engines, generators, propellers, pumps, and cranes to shipbuilders in Japan and throughout the world. Shipping lies at the core of global logistics.
 Ships of all different types are fitted with equipment supplied by the Marine Machinery Division. These range from gas carriers that transport LNG or LPG through to oil tankers that carry crude oil; bulk carriers that transport grain, coal, or iron ore; container ships, and passenger vessels.<br><br>
 In addition to the export of machinery, we also collaborate with shipyards in Japan to supply vessel’s design and technical support to overseas shipbuilders, and offer a variety of package deals whereby we supply a complete set of marine machinery.<br><br>
 We are also actively involved in environmental protection measures, as a sales agency for a Chinese manufacturer for the sale of ballast water treatment systems to Japanese shipyards. Marine organisms that are carried along with the ballast water in ocean-going vessels are recognized internationally as a problem with a significant impact on ecosystems.
 Also, the Commercial Vessel Dept. of Mitsubishi Corporation orders and builds several dozen vessels each year for the company’s own use or for Japanese or overseas ship owners. We are closely involved in selecting the equipment to be fitted in these vessels.<br><br>
 While the Japanese shipbuilding industry has been said to be shrinking in the face of rapid growth by the shipbuilding industries of China, South Korea, and elsewhere, it remains the world’s third largest. We intend to continue underpinning logistics systems around the world through ongoing growth in conjunction with shipyards and other marine equipment manufacturers.<br><br>


 The Aerospace Division consists of the Aerospace Systems Department at Headquarters and the Nagoya Branch, with additional personnel stationed in the U.S.A. Its main activities are the importing and sourcing of aerospace systems, equipment, and civilian helicopters, and the associated after-sales service. In the defense and space sectors, the division’s activities include importing and sourcing systems and other products from major US aerospace manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Sikorsky, Northrop Grumman, and Honeywell, for Japan Ministry of Defense and Self-Defense Forces, and for manufacturers in Japan. Products handled by the division include aircraft systems, shipboard systems, guidance systems, and space equipment. It also provides support for the licensing production between Japanese manufacturers and overseas manufacturers. In the civilian sector, the division imports helicopters from Sikorsky for government agencies and private companies. In addition to importing and after-sales service, the division also collaborates with Mitsubishi Corporation to collect and provide high-quality information and offer solutions that meet in Japan and overseas. In the future, the division plans to utilize the experience it has built up over many years in the aerospace sector to actively promote promising systems and products from overseas suppliers in Japan. Through these activities, the division works steadily to prove its worth by taking a global approach to supplying a wide range of services to various customers in the aerospace sector. It intends to work together with Mitsubishi Corporation to contribute to Japan’s increasingly important national security and disaster management in the land, sea, and air theatres, including through the handling of a wide range of systems and products for which Mitsubishi Corporation is the agent.<br><br>

Corporate Planning Department <br><br>
To act as a platform for the machinery and infrastructure plant trading activities of Mitsubishi Corporation, the roles of Mitsubishi Corporation Machinery, Inc. include both sales of entire plants and merger of other companies, through which we expand our business operations. As part of these activities, the Corporate Planning Department handles not only its existing responsibilities for the formulation of business plans and dealing with Security Trade Control and Trade Procedures Control on exports and imports business, but also ongoing tasks such as the transfer of new business from Mitsubishi Corporation and the reviewing development of our new business organization. For the further development of our company, the Corporate Planning Department intends to work together with other divisions to take on a variety of challenges.<br><br>
