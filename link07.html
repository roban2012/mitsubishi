Mitsubishi Corporation Technos was founded in July 1971 as a trading firm engaged in the sale of machine tools. Thereafter, the subsequent surge in industrial development in Japan gave us a boost in establishing a broader foundation as a trading firm specializing in industrial machinery. We expanded our operations beyond machine tools to include plant facilities, such as robots, carrier systems, assembly lines, measuring/inspection devices, washing equipment, and painting systems, as well as clean energy facilities, beverage and food machinery, and equipment for retailers.<br><br>

On the global stage, we began making active advances into overseas markets in the 1990s, and have established operational centers in eight countries to date. Through this extensive network, we have accumulated steady results as a strategic global partner in the world of manufacturing.<br><br>

We have come thus far to where we are today thanks to our stakeholders' ceaseless support and guidance, for which we are ever grateful.<br><br>

In the Japanese machine tool manufacturing industry today, external demand is said to account for as much as 70% of total demand. This demand structure is also seen in Japan's manufacturing industries as a whole, where the advancement of free trade has promoted globalization and has given rapid rise to borderless markets. In terms of the world at large, our market has thus expanded significantly, and our customers have begun to engage in manufacturing from a worldwide perspective.<br><br>

Given this rapid transition of the market in terms of both region and content, we at Mitsubishi Corporation Technos have reaffirmed the importance of developing human resources and engineering capacities with a constant eye on the trends of the times. We have also strengthened our commitment to satisfy market needs by gaining a broad, comprehensive view of situations inside and outside of Japan, and to support the evolution of manufacturing within the entire value chain in close cooperation with our customers and manufacturers.<br><br>

Through the dedicated efforts of each and every one of our employees, we will strive to become a leading company that offers proactive services and seeks continuous growth as a strategic partner to all our stakeholders. We ask for your continued support and patronage as we pursue our mission with unwavering dedication.<br><br>
