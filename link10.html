Securing suplly sources globally<br><br>
Mineral resources trading<br><br>
Relocating Sales Strategy Functions With an Eye on the Fast-growing Asian Market<br><br>
<a href= "pic14.html">Market Strategy Map</a><br><br>

In December 2012, MC established Mitsubishi Corporation RtM* International Pte. Ltd. (RtM International), in Singapore, with the aim of further strengthening our mineral resources trading operations. The new company began operating in April 2013. Before the establishment of RtM International, MC's mineral resources trading business was organized in terms of commodities, namely ferrous raw materials and non-ferrous metals. RtM International takes trading beyond this traditional approach. It will play a central role in developing business strategies with an eye on world markets and will also integrate management of credit and market risk. With these and other responsibilities, RtM International will work to capture growth potential in markets around the world such as Asia and raise its responsiveness to the market.<br><br>

Along with establishing RtM International, MC integrated Mitsubishi Corporation Unimetals Ltd., a core company in the non-ferrous metals field into Mitsubishi Corporation RtM Japan Ltd., which is now responsible for all mineral resources. This move has strengthened the level of response to the market and customers in Japan.<br><br>

*RtM stands for “Resources to Market.” MC named the new subsidiary company RtM International due to its objective of realizing sustainable growth over the medium to long term through capacity enhancement which enables it to effectively bridge the gap between producers and end-users and to add value to the whole supply chain.<br><br>

Foods<br><br>
Building a Grain Sourcing Network Across the Americas<br><br>

MC has built a network over many years for stably procuring grain and other food resources from producing countries and supplying customers around the world. Through AGREX, Inc. in the U.S., a major growing country, and Riverina (Australia) Pty., Ltd. in Australia, we have grain handling infrastructure that extends from collection in inland growing regions to transportation to export ports. In 2012, we augmented this network by purchasing a 20% stake in Brazilian grain company Los Grobo Ceagro do Brasil S.A. (Ceagro). In addition to this equity interest, we acquired the right to purchase grain preferentially from Ceagro, thus securing a supply source from South America. Recently, we reached agreement to raise our equity interest in Ceagro to 80%, thereby further strengthening our grain procurement ability.<br><br>

Meanwhile, in China, where demand for food is rising rapidly, we are a shareholder in a meat business run by COFCO Limited (COFCO)*, with which we have also signed a basic agreement for supplying up to 5 million tons of soybeans a year. In tandem, we are working to capture growing demand.<br><br>

While seeking to expand our food and commodity supply sources globally, mainly in North and South America and Australia, we aim to handle approximately 20 million tons of grain commodities per year, namely corn, soybeans and wheat. We also seek to expand our businesses in processed grain products in importing regions, mainly Japan, China and Southeast Asia, to meet growing demand for food, especially in Asia.<br><br>

*COFCO is one of China's largest state-owned food companies.
<br><br>
Establishing local presence within Asia<br><br>
Automobile Operations<br><br>
Strengthening Thailand and Indonesian Operations and Replicating Business Models in Neighboring Asian Countries
<br><br>
MC has been conducting Isuzu automobile operations in Thailand since commencing import agency operations there in 1957. After establishing Tri Petch Isuzu Sales Co., Ltd. (TIS) in 1974, we have expanded our sales and service capabilities to match local needs with the top-selling D-MAX pickup truck. We have a value chain centered on TIS that extends from production through sales, automobile finance and after-sales service. We are now redoubling our efforts to increase customer satisfaction, enhance after-sales service and make other improvements to our operations based on more than half a century of expertise.<br><br>

Meanwhile, in Indonesia, PT. Krama Yudha Tiga Berlian Motors (KTB) began operations in 1970 as an exclusive distributor to import and sell vehicles produced by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) and Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation. At present, in addition to manufacturing and selling vehicles, the KTB Group is engaged in a wide range of businesses, including automobile finance, used car sales, and rental cars. Japan's automakers are eyeing the Indonesian auto market as a growth market and making substantial investments in the country. With a solid position in the commercial vehicle market in Indonesia, KTB is now working to increase its presence in the passenger car market through new model launches and other measures.<br><br>

In our automobile operations in Thailand and Indonesia, we are endeavoring to strengthen our established local businesses, and at the same time leverage the expertise we have amassed from operations in these two countries to develop businesses in other markets<br><br>
