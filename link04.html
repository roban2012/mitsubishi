Mitsubishi Corporation Asset Management Ltd. (“MCAM”, renamed in October, last year from the previous Mitsubishi Corporation Capital Ltd.) was incorporated in 1999 to act as a successor of the Asset Management and Merchant Banking Department of Mitsubishi Corporation, Japan’s leading General Trading Company (“Sogo-Shosya”). Our current main business comprises provision of leading-edge financial products and services to such our customers as qualified institutional investors as well as proposing of investment strategies based on our in-depth knowledge and expertise to such our customers as pension funds, by taking advantage of the full four kinds of licenses held by us for the financial instruments business.<br><br>

At Mitsubishi Corporation, our parent organization, experience had been accumulated since the middle of the 1980’s as part of its investment activity in financial markets with its own funds as well as through investments into various funds such as hedge funds and private equity (PE) funds. These experiences had helped to develop a vast amount of expertise, knowledge and information base in the alternative investment area. Furthermore, a wide-ranged network with overseas leading financial institutions and fund managers too, was developed through the aforesaid investment related activities. Various investment activities had also been actively conducted in the area of commodities, infrastructure and real estate, corporate investments etc. by utilizing its global network and information base owned as a General Trading Company.<br><br>

Such assets owned by Mitsubishi Corporation should be referred as investment culture to financial assets and real assets and have been certainly succeeded to MCAM. Thus and as a core strategic subsidiary in the asset management business promoted by the Financial Business Group of Mitsubishi Corporation, we serve as the prime contact point for domestic investors towards their alternative investment actability.<br><br>

We, at MCAM, will continue to focus on providing attractive products and services that match the various needs of customers, including provision of financial products, proposal of financial strategies etc. based on financial products in alternative areas as well as on real assets that only General Trading Companies can provide.<br><br>

现今,中国是日本最大的贸易对象国,中日之间的经济关系密不可分。对于日本企业来说中国是不可缺少的生产地,同时近年来中国作为消费市场的重要性也在不断增加。在此情况下,许多拥有先进技术的日本中小企业在中国以及海外市场都具有飞速成长的潜力,但是,同时有不少日本企业存在资金,网络及商业资源不足等问题。<br><br>
 
（此基金的目标）<br><br>
此基金旨在帮助拥有先进的技术.品牌,服务,经营管理的日本企业发展中国事业,为以下①～③三类企业提供资金,充分利用本公司作为综合商社在各个产业所拥有的商业资源与经验,以及科瑞集团在所拥有的出色的投资业绩及其与优良的中国企业所建立的业务网络,为投资目标企业在经营以及事业拓展方面提供帮助,不断提升企业价值。更进一步来说,还可以谋求投资对象企业在资金周转活跃的香港以及海外的资本市场上市,为其拓展中国业务提供资金保障。<br><br>
①通过在中国开展业务,从而有可能壮大成长的日本企业<br><br>
②日本企业在中国成立的合资公司<br><br>
③有可能成为日本企业的战略伙伴的中国企业<br><br>
  
此外,本公司出资100%成立了Kizuna Capital Partners(暂定名),以协助此基金发掘可以作为投资对象的日本企业,并为投资建言。<br><br>

在这样的认知下，具有对产业方面丰富认知的三菱商事与拥有卓越投资业绩并同中国企业有广泛网络的科瑞集团共同出资，在2011年8 月成立了MC Creat Investment（香港、基金总规模：120百万美元），与此同时作为在日本方面的咨询公司，设立了Kizuna Capital partners（日本企业与世界接轨是公司名称的由来）。<br><br>
